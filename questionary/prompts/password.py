    This question type can be used to prompt the user for information
    that should not be shown in the command line. The typed text will be
    replaced with `*`.

    Args:
        message: Question text

        default: Default value will be returned if the user just hits
                 enter.

        validate: Require the entered value to pass a validation. The
                  value can not be submited until the validator accepts
                  it (e.g. to check minimum password length).

                  This can either be a function accepting the input and
                  returning a boolean, or an class reference to a
                  subclass of the prompt toolkit Validator class.

        qmark: Question prefix displayed in front of the question.
               By default this is a `?`

        style: A custom color and style for the question parts. You can
               configure colors as well as font types for different elements.

    Returns:
        Question: Question instance, ready to be prompted (using `.ask()`).
